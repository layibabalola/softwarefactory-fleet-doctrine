## mlv-app/atomic-replace-denied-while-a-reader-holds-the-destination
rule: a temp-file-plus-move receipt write must retry a denied replace for a bounded time, and a state file read by another process must be written temp-then-move, never by a bare Set-Content.
mechanism: [IO.File]::Move(tmp, dest, overwrite) throws "Access to the path is denied" while any reader holds dest open without FILE_SHARE_DELETE (a Python open() poll, antivirus, an indexer); the lane launcher then recorded exit -999 and a failed receipt for work that had succeeded. Separately, Set-Content creates the file empty before its first flush, so a writer killed in that window leaves a zero-length JSON file that a reader fails on at char 0.

## mlv-app/a-timeout-reserved-in-a-shared-budget-starves-the-child
rule: a scheduler that starts a child only while the shared per-beat budget still holds the child's FULL timeout has a start window of budget minus timeout. Keep the start threshold separate from the timeout, check the remaining budget before every launch, and give back (deferred, never a failure) a launch the budget would clip; persist deferred candidates and scan them first next beat.
mechanism: the board's key scheduler ran a 50 s beat and reserved the 45 s key-round timeout, so a round could start only in the first ~5 s. When the cheap work before it ran longer, the round was deferred every beat with no failure recorded: one pull request sat deferred 15+ min and was keyed by hand twice. Across 39 real keyed beats (round included) the time was min 4.6 s, median 10.8 s, max 51.4 s, and 33 were <= 20.9 s; the slowest four were rounds that ran to their timeout before any budget guard. The live fix set the start threshold to 20 s from the 33-of-39 figure. Distinct from the checkpoint-overshoot entry: that guard is too lax, this one too strict.
check: read the launch guard: the start threshold must sit below the child's timeout and cover a typical run (a threshold at the worst run cannot also be under the timeout). Run one beat with the budget nearly spent and expect a give-back with no failure counted, then a fresh beat that starts the child. Measured: before the fix one PR was deferred every beat; after it one scheduled beat keyed it in 6.9 s.
supersedes: none
evidence: measured
- **Guard:** none yet in tracked code (the scheduler is untracked board tooling; follow-up MECHKEYS-STARVE-LOOP-CAP-1). Residual risk: a round that persistently exceeds the start threshold now starves silently, so give-backs need a consecutive-count cap.

## mlv-app/an-absolute-cpu-quiet-gate-starves-on-an-owner-used-host
rule: on a host the owner also uses, an absolute CPU quiet gate (here 20 percent) passes rarely and unevenly. Do not relax it and do not exclude processes from it. First log its pass rate per hour and attribute the load from system counters; for RELATIVE claims judge paired comparability (ABBA order, a ceiling on the load gap between arms) and label such pairs loaded-comparable, never quiet.
mechanism: over the probe history 25 verdicts were QUIET against 45 COOLDOWN_UNMET, and 25 of 293 probes read at or below 20 percent; ~41 percent of probes passed in one 3-hour window and ~2 percent elsewhere (one day of data: a hypothesis). A non-elevated per-process probe cannot attribute kernel or SYSTEM time: the top 5 processes explained ~6 of a ~28-point mean, so neither a higher threshold nor an exclusion list is a fix. Load does damage legs: one decode timing read 47.06 at 49.6 percent pre-load against 7.02 for its twin at 18.4. Distinct from the card where a gate counted a foreign runner's test host as load (fixed by ancestry): here the load is real and no per-process view can name it.
check: `Get-Counter '\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time','\Processor(_Total)\% Privileged Time','\Processor(_Total)\% DPC Time','\Process(*)\% Processor Time' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` (without the flag, exited processes raise an invalid-sample error); sum the Status-0 Process samples other than _total and idle, divide by the logical CPU count, and compare with _Total (a gap over ~5 points is unattributed load). Count QUIET probes per hour from the gate log before tuning anything.
supersedes: none
evidence: measured
- **Guard:** none yet (VENUE-QUIET-ATTRIBUTION-1 will extend tools/repo_hygiene/test_dual_venue_evidence.py). The gate was deliberately not relaxed.
