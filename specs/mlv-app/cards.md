## mlv-app/atomic-replace-denied-while-a-reader-holds-the-destination
rule: a temp-file-plus-move receipt write must retry a denied replace for a bounded time, and a state file read by another process must be written temp-then-move, never by a bare Set-Content.
mechanism: [IO.File]::Move(tmp, dest, overwrite) throws "Access to the path is denied" while any reader holds dest open without FILE_SHARE_DELETE (a Python open() poll, antivirus, an indexer); the lane launcher then recorded exit -999 and a failed receipt for work that had succeeded. Separately, Set-Content creates the file empty before its first flush, so a writer killed in that window leaves a zero-length JSON file that a reader fails on at char 0.
