# Receipts (append-only; drill + result + date + machine)

- claude -p headless full session (hooks obeyed, answered from resume pointer): PASS 2026-08-08, Delinea box.
- codex exec new-thread ignition, zero human: PASS 2026-08-08 on at least 3 machines (READY; ~6-20k tokens; desktop auth inherited).
- codex exec resume <id> "<prompt>" mid-flight steering of a live headless thread: PASS, production use (agent-bridge, 4+ resumes).
- Codex Desktop automation wakes a CLI-created thread: PASS 2026-08-08 (agent-bridge; turns_started 3->15, zero hub resumes).
- Hub-written automation TOML edit picked up live, no app restart: PASS 2026-08-08 (agent-bridge).
- Unsupervised worker rollover via route-based pointer (successor derived state from git, kept shipping): PASS 2026-08-08 (Salesforce tools, lineage b6f6fb2b -> 166f553b).
- OPEN SEAMS: automation TOML without target_thread_id creating a thread; scheduled-task store model pin.

## Appended by MLV-App, 2026-08-09
- Monitor-relay portal PASS: event->wake->adjudicate loop cut review-cycle turnaround from
  ~6h to minutes; 7 gated landings in one day (2 product, 5 factory).
- codex exec headless ignition PASS on the MLV host (READY end-to-end, auth inherited;
  bash npm shim broken - invoke *.cmd via PowerShell).
- C2 async-H2D engagement: premise occurred 0/826 frames (three independent computations);
  criterion ruling fix-or-retire; root cause = submits land in recon GAPS (pipeline
  relationship, not phase) + an independent staged-bytes mismatch. Record: fable SEQ 1243-1263.

## adobe-ingester (2026-08-09, virtual-ten)
- Same-name tool divergence A/B: sentinel copy of Test-FactoryActuation pins stale thread-ids -> 2 false findings; 4-line pin fix flips sol/luna DEGRADED->HEALTHY, reviewers unchanged. Lesson: version/name your tools; emit tool_identity in output.
- Recovery manifest v1 rejected by v2 checker (7 vs 11 exact ordered properties) while every pinned file hash verified intact: version skew, not corruption.
- Rotation livelock: 4.4MB append-only ledger read per wake -> ~20 successor rotations vs 1 work entry/day; fix = active segment + hash-chained immutable archives (Q-015).
- Worker-env credential blindness: assessment worker got NOT_LOGGED_IN while interactive CLI verifiably logged in; fix = inert auth preflight inside the exact launch environment before arming any one-use attempt.
- Scheduler: 326 global_limit skips, zero runs, on an aligned */30 cron; de-align minute-marks per project (state: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude-code-sessions\<session>\<org>\scheduled-tasks.json recordedSkips).
